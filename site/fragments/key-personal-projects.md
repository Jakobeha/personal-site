#### Key personal projects:

- **[nominalscript](https://github.com/Jakobeha/nominalscript)**: Nominal type system over TypeScript, similar to how [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/) are structural type systems over JavaScript. A subset of the type system is defined and various properties are proven in Coq (reflexivity, antisymmetry, transitivity, top, bottom).
- **[TreeScript](https://github.com/Jakobeha/treescript)**: A language to transform other languages' syntax. Similar to [coccinelle](https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/), but more basic and language-agnostic.
- **Descript ([v1 (Haskell)](https://bitbucket.org/jakobeha/descript-lang/src/master/) and [v2 (OCaml)](https://bitbucket.org/jakobeha/descript-ocaml/src/master/))**: A language designed to transform its own syntax. Descript programs can be applied to other source files, actually modifying them on the file-system.
